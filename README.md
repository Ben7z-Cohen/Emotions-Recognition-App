# Emotions-Recognition-App
**Overview**<br/>
Using FisherFace and Haar-like features techniques to identify "emotions" (Facial expression) in real time.
The app is controlled by GUI to present the identification.<br/>
The app would collect the "emotions" over a period of time and provide grapical analysis using bokeh module.
NOTE: At the moment the classifier was created with a small dataset for only three "emotions" and the identifications need some improvments.  

**Work in progress:**<br/>                                                                                                                  Replacing FisherFace classifier to CNN classifier.<br/>
