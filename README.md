# Emotion-Recognition-App
**Overview**<br/>
Using FisherFace and Haar-like features techniques to identify "emotions" (Facial expression) in real time.
The app is controlled by GUI to present the identification.
Furthermore, the app would collect the "emotions" over a period of time and provide grapical analysis using bokeh module.
NOTE: At the moment the classifier is created pre-running with a small dataset - the results are bad.

**Work in progress:**<br/>                                                                                                                  1. Using CNN classifier.<br/>                                                                                                                2. Implementing OOP design & adjusting the syntax to PEP 8.
