# Emotions-Recognition-App
**Overview**<br/>
Using FisherFace and Haar-like features techniques to identify "emotions" (Facial expression) in real time.
The application is controlled by GUI which presents the identification.<br/>
The application would collect the "emotions" over a period of time and provide grapical analysis using bokeh module.<br/>
NOTE: at the moment the classifier was created with a small dataset for only three "emotions" and the identifications need some improvements.

**Work in progress:**<br/>                                                                                                                  Replacing FisherFace classifier with CNN classifier.<br/>
