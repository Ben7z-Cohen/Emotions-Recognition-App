# Emotion-Recognition-App
Using FisherFace and Haar-like features techniques to identify "emotions" (Facial expression) in real time.
The App is controlled by GUI which can show the identification.
Furthermore, the app would collect the "emotions" over a period of time and provide grapical analysis using Bokeh.
NOTE: at the moment the classifier is created in real time with a small dataset - the results are not that good.
The next step is to train CNN/SSD with a large dataset, getting the weights and provide better results. 

WIP - implementing OOP design for the app & adjusting the syntax to PEP 8.
