# Emotion-Recognition-App
Using FisherFace and Haar-like features techniques to identify "emotions" (Facial expression) in real time.
The App is controlled by GUI which can show the identification.
Furthermore, the app would collect the "emotions" over a period of time and provide grapical analysis using bokeh module.
NOTE: At the moment the classifier is created pre-running with a small dataset - the results are bad.
